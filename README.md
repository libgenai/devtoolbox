Online utilities for formatting, encoding/decoding etc are dangerous to use (many of them steal secrets from your data) and are in fact prohibited at many workplaces. This offline desktop app is a collection of many such utilities:

 - Base64 Encoding/Decoding
 - JSON Formatting / Validating / Extracting
 - JSON <-> YAML Conversion
 - QR Image <-> Text Conversion
 - JWT Inspection
 - More coming soon

This app is written in Flutter and therefore, works on MacOS, Linux, Windows and even Web if your org would like to host it internally as a webapp. But do not expect this to work on Android and iOS.
